This will spoof emails and spam them

Do u know someone that has one of those custom emails like FortniteKid@iloverfortnite69420.gg, well most likey they have no prottection
how do I find te email server?
Most email servers are not hosted where the website is hosted u can check with a quick nmap scan but most likely they will not be.

So how do I find out?
use nslookup

/ command line
nslookup *ENTER*
set type=mx *ENTER*
iloverfortnite69420.gg *ENTER

\command line

they will apear there and u just use the first one as long as its not aspmx.google.com our outloook because u cant spoof those but the others u can check


WARNING:
Soe ISP's have theyre ips backlisted to sending emails directly to the internet depending on spam filters sometimes VPN's will have those too what I recommend you use is google cloud console its free, easy and u get a google ip.
